            <p>It is one of the most popular countries in south east Asia visited by the backpackers across the world,
                but it
                still isn’t the country that people go visiting back like its neighbor Thailand, which converts many of
                its visitors to permanent fans that end up going there back and forth. While Vietnam clicks with most
                people, it’s a shame that still many aren’t aware how gorgeous this country is! Maybe they didn’t know a
                few things or they hadn’t prepared or planned well. Whatever the reason is, knowing a few things before
                will give you an idea of what to expect in Vietnam, making you like and enjoy it when you visit. So go
                ahead and check out these things to know before going to Vietnam.

            <h1 class="title">their Specialities</h1>
            <p>Vietnamese food is distinct and unforgettable. The cuisine relies on a balance of salty, sweet, sour and
                hot flavours, achieved through use of nuoc mam, a fermented fish sauce, cane sugar, the juice of
                kalamansi citrus fruit or tamarind and chilli peppers. Dishes use plenty of fresh herbs but tend not to
                be overly spicy, as chilli sauces are served separately. We've picked 3 essentials Vietnamese foods
