                <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has congratulated his Vietnamese counterpart on the country's
                    "decisive handling" of the Covid-19 pandemic. <br>

                    Mr Lee spoke to Vietnam's Prime Minister, Mr Nguyen Xuan Phuc, on Friday (May 29) afternoon, during
                    which the two leaders also agreed to keep markets open and supply chains connected. <br>

                    Vietnam's response to the coronavirus outbreak has drawn international praise. The country, which
                    has reported zero deaths from Covid-19, began easing its lockdown last month. <br>
                    "I congratulated Vietnamese PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Vietnam's decisive handling of the Covid-19
                    pandemic when we spoke this afternoon. I thanked him, too, for Vietnam's generous donations of face
                    masks and test kits to Singapore," Mr Lee said in a Facebook post on Friday.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he will start to end preferential treatment for Hong Kong
                    in trade and travel, in response to a new security law pushed by Beijing. <br>
                    He described the Chinese government's moves to introduce the measure in Hong Kong as a "tragedy".
                    Mr Trump also said he was "terminating" the US relationship with the World Health Organization over
                    Covid-19. <br>
                    China has told the West to "stop interfering" in Hong Kong. <br>
                    The territory, a former British colony, enjoys unique freedoms not seen in mainland China. But many
                    people there see the looming security law as bringing an end to Hong Kong's special status, agreed
                    under a 1984 agreement between China and the UK. <br>
                    There are fears the proposed measure - which has sparked a wave of anti-mainland protests - could
                    quash freedoms by making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority in the territory. <br>
                    This week, Britain said that if China went forward with the law, it could offer British National
                    (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong a path to UK citizenship.</p>

                <p>A British pilot who was critically ill with Covid-19 in Vietnam has awoken from a coma and is showing
                    signs of improvement, yet his long-term outlook remains ominous, doctors have said. <br>
                    The man, 43, who works for Vietnam Airlines, had awoken from a coma and was capable of basic
                    communication after doctors reduced his levels of sedative medication, Vietnamese state media
                    announced on Wednesday. <br>
                    The patient, referred to in Vietnam as Patient 91, developed a fever and cough on 17 March and was
                    later admitted to Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Since then, he has spent more
                    than two months on life support. Tran Thanh Linh, the deputy head of Ho Chi Minh City-based Cho Ray
                    hospital’s intensive care unit, told local media the man was able to perform simple gestures such as
                    moving fingers and toes, yet breathing issues, organ damage and limb weaknesses remain. <br>

                    The pilot is on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine (ECMO), a form of life support used
                    when a person’s heart or lungs are unable to fully function, and is being treated with antibiotics,
                    according to a report posted on the government’s official news portal early in May. <br>

                <p>China loans more money to the world than the richest 32 nations. Plus, the man behind a $1 trillion
                    stock market crash. <br>
                    China has been rapidly rolling out its Belt and Road Initiative to build new roads, ports and rail
                    lines in mostly developing nations, extending the country's reach across continents.<br>

                    China says the infrastructure will benefit countries while critics say China is extending unfair
                    influence over others.
                    <br>
                    Many nations have been rethinking their involvement amid accusations that China has overpriced
                    projects.<br>

                    Between 2000 and 2017, the world's debt obligations to China rose from $500bn to a staggering $5
                    trillion - about six percent of the world's economic output - according to the Kiel Institute for
                    the World Economy.<br>

                    Researchers also found that China and its subsidiaries have lent $1.5 trillion directly to 150
                    nations - making China the world's biggest creditor. It has also made unreported loans worth
                    $200bn.<br>
