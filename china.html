                    China has been rapidly rolling out its Belt and Road Initiative to build new roads, ports and rail
                    lines in mostly developing nations, extending the country's reach across continents.<br>

                    Many nations have been rethinking their involvement amid accusations that China has overpriced
                    projects.<br>

                    Between 2000 and 2017, the world's debt obligations to China rose from $500bn to a staggering $5

                    the World Economy.<br>

                    Researchers also found that China and its subsidiaries have lent $1.5 trillion directly to 150
                    nations - making China the world's biggest creditor. It has also made unreported loans worth
                    $200bn.<br>
