        <div class="introduction">
            <p>China is the most populous country in the world. It has a continuous culture stretching back nearly
                4,000 years and is at the origine of many of the foundations of our modern world. <br>This country
                is
                located at the east of the Asian continent. The east of the country is bordered by the Pacific Ocean
                and the rest of the borders are shared with many countries like Russia, Vietnam, North Korea and so
                on. Its vast territory allows to find a great diversity of natural landscapes, from the plain to the
                mountains, the desert to the forests, small rivers with long rivers, from the sea to the big lakes
                …<br>
                It is difficult not to find what we love in China. With a history of over 5000 years and its many
                ethnic groups, China also offers a wide cultural panel with many aspects to discover. China is
                divided into 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities and 2 special administrative
                regions.<br>
                Today, China is the world's fastest-growing country, as well as an export leader. This country is
                now a major overseas investor and is pursuing an increasingly assertive foreign and defence policy.

                    I know you were waiting for this. Let’s talk about food then, since it’s almost time for lunch.
                    Chinese food is everywhere, whether you are going out to restaurants or ordering food at home,
                    you are sure to have tried out Chinese one time in your life. So why are Chinese foods so
                    popular?<br>
                    The answer is, Chinese cuisine is incredibly diverse. Chinese food has a global appeal with its
                    tastes suiting people in any parts of the world. Chinese food today is not the exact sort of
                    food that you will find in China, it has a blend of the traditional roots and a part of the
                    culture of the present countries where they are found. Which give unique taste experiences.<br>
                    So, I have chosen 5 Chinese foods that you must try right now. You absolutly need to try hot
                    pot, dumplings, peking roast duck and of course, steamed vermicelli rolls.<br>

                <h3>What to visit in China</h3>

                    After some research, we suggest you visit Beijing, Xi’an, and Shanghai for your first trip,
                    extending it to Guilin and Chengdu if you have the time.<br>
                    As imperial and modern capital of China, Beijing is a must-see according to
                    us. Firstly because it is the home to many icons of China's imperial and recent past and also
                    because it is China's top gateway city. If you only have one day, we propose you to make sure
                    you set a foot on the Great Wall of China, and the Forbidden City. With a bit more time, the
                    Temple of Heaven and its park will transport you deeper into the culture of China, along with a
                    tour of the Hutongs and the Summer Palace.<br>
                    Shanghai is China's largest city, and many would say it must be visited for
                    its significance. It is a convenient city to arrive at or depart from. There aren't so many
                    world-class tourist sights, and it could be toured in one day. So if you have decided to get
                    there, make sure you see the colonial and sky-rise architecture of the Bund. If your schedule
                    allows, you might extend your tour to one of the water town, Hangzhou, Suzhou, or Huangshan.<br>
                    Next you should discover where the nation of China really began. Visit Xi'an,
                    where First Emperor Qin ruled from the first capital of a united China. Xi'an is an excellent
                    place to experience something of the pre-Beijing dynasties. See the grand Terracotta Army,
                    temples, a mosque, pagodas, and towers that are more than 1,000 years old.<br>
                    First-timers love Guilin for its beautiful landscapes and as a relaxing escape
                    from the cities. If your time is limited, enjoy karst peaks combine sublimely with the Li River
                    and cycle around the idyllic countryside in Yangshuo, and even experience to be a Chinese
                    farmer. If you are interested in minority culture, spend one or two days at the Longji Rice
                    Terraces to enjoy the magnificent tiered fields and experience the world of the Zhuang and Yao
                    minorities.<br>
                    Chengdu's giant pandas are for many the icing on the cake, the finishing
                    touch to a China must-do list. In this city, you can take part in a giant panda volunteer
                    program to have a close look at the cute pandas, see cultural landmarks, and try spicy Sichuan
                    hotpot.<br>

                <p>
                    When it comes to China we have to talk about the political context since 1949, As you may know
                    china, or shall we call it the people’s republic of China is led by the communist party and it
                    has been like this for decades.<br>
                    It all started in 1949 when Mao Zedong After facing Tchang kai chek gets to lead china and then
                    left a huge communism mark all over the country.<br>
                    So it’s no longer a surprise that the country still has a strong communist political line.
                    Currently the president is Xi Jinping.<br> Although the fact that communist rules the country
                    for so
                    long may seems great and may show how stable the country is we have to point that people’s
                    republic of China is considered by many as a dictatorship, among others because the only
                    political party is the communist one.<br>

                <p>
                    To conclude, even though China may seem intimidating due to technological monitoring, it’s
                    political context and because of the language barrier, we can clearly see that china is a vast
                    country , at least as vast as surprising and is a place of cultural richness. And to be
                    perfectly honest I would go there with pleasure only to taste the food.
